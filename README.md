# Portfolio
## Nicholas Sima

I've finally decided to make a portfolio for some of my coolest coding projects. This is all done in plain HTML, CSS, and JS. No libraries, only looks good and functions properly on desktop browser, don't ask for more.

Now I love computers! Take a look at some of my coolest work. You can view this portfolio through the Github Page located in the Pages tab to the right of this text.
